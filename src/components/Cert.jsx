                The following certifications are just a small collection of what I have achieved over 
                the last few years. There are a lot more that I did not list as they have expired.
                But they do include certifications from the EC-Council for ethical hacking, Splunk 
                for security monitoring, Dell/EMC for data science, and Cisco Systems for networking.
