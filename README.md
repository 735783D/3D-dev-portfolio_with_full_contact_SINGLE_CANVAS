# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This website was built using a walkthrough that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k). I elaborated on it to specify my personal touch as well as my own accomplishments. Feel free to fork or 
download the source code and make your own. I really loved making this practice site.
